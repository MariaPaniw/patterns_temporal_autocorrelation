The work test sensitivity of the stochastic population growth rate to temporal autocorrelation in vital rates among plant and animal populations.  

**ABSTRACT**

Temporal autocorrelation in demographic processes often shapes population dynamics, but a comprehensive cross-taxonomic examination of its effects is lacking. We implement stochastic simulations of matrix population models from 321 plant, 4 algae, and 100 animal species to investigate the effects of temporal autocorrelation on their stochastic growth rates (log λs). Performing a phylogenetically-informed PCA on elasticities of population growth to demographic processes, we found two continua of life-history strategies. Along the first continuum, slow life histories exhibit lower sensitivity of log λs to temporal autocorrelation than species with fast strategies. The second continuum is dominated by species with dormant stages, namely plants with seedbanks, showing high sensitivity to temporal autocorrelation, even under a slow strategy. The effects of temporal autocorrelation differed between habitat types. We provide global cross-taxonomic evidence that temporal autocorrelation may affects a wider range of species than previously thought, including those with fast and complex life histories.
