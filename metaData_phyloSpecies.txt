lambda: deterministic asymptotic population growth rate for each transition
habitat: five habitat categories derived from Ecoregion 
TACmodeled: was autocorrelated environmental variation modeled
envStochModeled: was environmental stochasticty modeled
megamatrices (patch dynamics) were used when  TACmodeled -> yes & envStochModeled -> no
note: was environmental variation assessed in the same population as recorded in COM(P)ADRE? 
invasive: was an invasive population modeled

NA - information could not be obtained
